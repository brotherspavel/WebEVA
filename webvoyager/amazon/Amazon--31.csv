For example, the Kodak PIXPRO Friendly Zoom FZ45-WH comes with a 4X optical zoom, and the Kodak PIXPRo FZ55-RD has a 5X optical zoom, neither meeting the requirement of at least a 10x zoom. It seems none of the displayed cameras currently meet the specified zoom capability.

This should narrow down the results to cameras with at least a 10x zoom."
