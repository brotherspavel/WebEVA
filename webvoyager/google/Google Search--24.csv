"What is the name of the star system closest to the Solar System, and what are the discovered planets in it?",type 'nearest star system to solar system discovered planets' into the search bar to find information about the closest star system to the Solar System and its planets. The search bar has a placeholder text 'Search'.,"The search results indicate that the star system closest to the Solar System is Proxima Centauri. It is home to multiple planets including Proxima b and Proxima c, and there is mention of Proxima d being the lightest yet discovered in this system by 2022. Proxima b is a potentially habitable Earth-sized planet in this star system, orbiting Proxima Centauri every 11 days."
"What is the name of the star system closest to the Solar System, and what are the discovered planets in it?",Summarizing last observations,"Based on the most recent observations, the search results indicate that the closest star system to the Solar System is Proxima Centauri. It hosts several planets, including Proxima b, a potentially habitable Earth-sized planet that orbits its star every 11 days. Proxima c is also mentioned as another planet within this system, believed to take about five years to complete an orbit. Additionally, Proxima d is noted as the lightest discovered planet in this system as of 2022. The screenshots from the search results page confirm this information and provide additional details, such as Proxima Centauri being located about 4.25 light-years from Earth and its classification as a faint red dwarf in the constellation of Centaurus.
