However, the response with calculated results such as final angle and length is not yet visible on the shown screenshot. The current display does not provide the solution or any error information."
"Give the final angle and final length after 6s of a Spring pendulum with spring equilibrium length=0.12m, initial length=0.24m, initial angle=80deg, mass=1kg, spring constant=120 N/m.","scroll down to check if the results have been loaded below the input field. By scrolling, you ensure that any results or further options related to the query become visible if they have loaded further down the page.","The WolframAlpha page has provided graphs for both ""Angle from vertical vs. time"" and ""Length vs. time."" From these graphs, you can determine the final angle and length at 6 seconds. The angle appears to be around -0.5 radians, and the length around 0.26 meters approximately. For precise values, you would need to refer to the exact data points from the graphs."
"Give the final angle and final length after 6s of a Spring pendulum with spring equilibrium length=0.12m, initial length=0.24m, initial angle=80deg, mass=1kg, spring constant=120 N/m.",closely examine the graphs of 'Angle from vertical vs. time' and 'Length vs. time' at 6 seconds to determine precise values for the final angle and length. This will provide the most accurate data from the available graphs.,"The graph for ""Angle from vertical vs. time"" shows that at 6 seconds, the angle is approximately -0.5 radians. The ""Length vs. time"" graph indicates that the length is approximately 0.26 meters. These values provide the final state of the spring pendulum after 6 seconds."
"Give the final angle and final length after 6s of a Spring pendulum with spring equilibrium length=0.12m, initial length=0.24m, initial angle=80deg, mass=1kg, spring constant=120 N/m.",Summarizing last observations,"This summary reflects only the most recent observations: From the graphs provided by WolframAlpha, at 6 seconds, the spring pendulum's angle from the vertical is approximately -0.5 radians, and the length is around 0.26 meters.
