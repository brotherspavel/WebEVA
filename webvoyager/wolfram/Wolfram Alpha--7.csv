"Give the final angle and final length after 6s of a Spring pendulum with spring equilibrium length=0.12m, initial length=0.24m, initial angle=80deg, mass=1kg, spring constant=120 N/m .","type 'spring pendulum final angle and length, equilibrium length=0.12m, initial length=0.24m, initial angle=80 degrees, mass=1 kg, spring constant=120 N/m, after 6 seconds' into the search bar to compute the required values using Wolfram Alpha's computational engine.","The search query was successfully executed on Wolfram Alpha, and the required values were computed. The final angle of the spring pendulum from the vertical after 6 seconds is approximately -73.26 degrees (or 1.279 radians), and the final length is approximately 25.21 cm. The user has successfully obtained the needed results for the final angle and length of the pendulum."
