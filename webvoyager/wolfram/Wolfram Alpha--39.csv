Use Wolfram alpha to write the expression of the ellipse x^2 + 3 y^2 = 4 rotated 33 degrees counterclockwise.,Going to https://www.wolframalpha.com/,Went to https://www.wolframalpha.com/
Use Wolfram alpha to write the expression of the ellipse x^2 + 3 y^2 = 4 rotated 33 degrees counterclockwise.,"type ""rotate x^2 + 3 y^2 = 4 by 33 degrees"" into the search bar with the placeholder 'Enter what you want to calculate or know about' to find the expression of the ellipse after rotation.","The user successfully entered the query on Wolfram Alpha, and the website has provided the rotated equation of the ellipse. The input is interpreted correctly, showing the rotation operation on the plane. The result includes the transformed curve equation, a rotation matrix, and a visual representation of the rotated ellipse against the original. This indicates that Wolfram Alpha successfully computed the new expression of the ellipse after a 33 degrees counterclockwise rotation."
Use Wolfram alpha to write the expression of the ellipse x^2 + 3 y^2 = 4 rotated 33 degrees counterclockwise.,Summarizing last observations,"The most recent observations show that the user successfully used Wolfram Alpha to determine the rotated expression of the ellipse given by \(x^2 + 3y^2 = 4\). After entering the query, Wolfram Alpha computed the new expression, showing a transformed curve equation and a rotation matrix. A visual representation illustrates the original and rotated ellipses.
