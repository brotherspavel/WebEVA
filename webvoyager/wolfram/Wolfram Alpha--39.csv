Use Wolfram alpha to write the expression of the ellipse x^2 + 3 y^2 = 4 rotated 33 degrees counterclockwise.,Going to https://www.wolframalpha.com/,Went to https://www.wolframalpha.com/
Use Wolfram alpha to write the expression of the ellipse x^2 + 3 y^2 = 4 rotated 33 degrees counterclockwise.,type 'rotate x^2 + 3y^2 = 4 by 33 degrees counterclockwise' into the search bar with placeholder 'Enter what you want to calculate or know about' to find the rotated equation of the ellipse.,"The user is at the Wolfram Alpha homepage, ready to enter a query in the search bar. However, they have not yet typed the query to rotate the ellipse equation. The next step is to input the expression 'rotate x^2 + 3y^2 = 4 by 33 degrees counterclockwise' into the search bar to get the desired rotated equation."
