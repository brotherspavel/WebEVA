Use Wolfram alpha to write the expression of the ellipse x^2 + 3 y^2 = 4 rotated 33 degrees counterclockwise.,"type ""rotate the equation x^2 + 3*y^2 = 4 by 33 degrees counterclockwise"" into the search bar with placeholder 'Enter what you want to calculate or know about'. This will prompt Wolfram Alpha to compute the rotation of the given ellipse.","The user has successfully inputted the command to rotate the equation of the ellipse x^2 + 3y^2 = 4 by 33 degrees counterclockwise into Wolfram Alpha. The output provided includes the transformed equation of the ellipse, the rotation matrix, the transformation equations, and a visual representation of the original and rotated ellipse. Specifically, the transformed equation is displayed as: \((x^2 + 3y^2 = 4) \rightarrow (x^2 \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{15}\right) - 2) + 2xy \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{15}\right) + 4 = y^2\left(2 + \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{15}\right)\right)\). The rotation matrix and transformation equations are also provided, confirming that the action was successful in Wolfram Alpha."
