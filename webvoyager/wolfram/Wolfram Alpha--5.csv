This will allow Wolfram Alpha to process and solve the differential equation.","The problem has been successfully inputted into Wolfram Alpha, and the solution for the differential equation \( y''(z) + \sin(y(z)) = 0 \) is displayed. It is classified as a second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation. The solutions given are in terms of the Jacobi amplitude function (am), with specific forms indicated for different constants. Sample plots of individual solutions are also shown, with initial conditions \( y(0) = 1, y'(0) = 0 \) and \( y(0) = 0, y'(0) = 1 \). The graphical representations of these solutions are provided as well."
