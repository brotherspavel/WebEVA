Let g(x) be the integral of x^2 cos(2x). Write the expression of g(x).,"type 'integral of x^2 * cos(2x)' in the search bar labeled 'Enter what you want to calculate or know about' and press Enter to find the expression of g(x), which is the integral of x^2 cos(2x).","The user successfully obtained the integral of \(x^2 \cos(2x)\) using Wolfram Alpha. The result is displayed as \(\int x^2 \cos(2x) \, dx = \frac{1}{4}((2x^2 - 1)\sin(2x) + 2x\cos(2x)) + \text{constant}\). This is the expression for \(g(x)\)."
