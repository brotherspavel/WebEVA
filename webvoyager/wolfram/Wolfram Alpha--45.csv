"A 175cm tall, 85kg, 40yo man climbs 2500 steps at about 18cm per step and 40 steps per minute. summarise the Metabolic properties.",Summarizing last observations,"The most recent observations indicate that after multiple attempts to process the input query on WolframAlpha, the user has now successfully entered a refined query ""calories burned climbing stairs 2500 steps"" with additional computed parameters visible in the current screenshots. The input details processed include a step rate of 50 steps per minute, step height of 6 inches, gender male, and body weight at 185 pounds. Consequently, WolframAlpha has generated a metabolic summary:

- Energy expenditure is calculated at 2389 kJ (kilojoules).
- The average energy expenditure is 0.96 kJ/step.
- Fat burned amounts to approximately 0.07399 kg.
- Oxygen consumption is 114.2 liters.
- The metabolic equivalent is 7.8 METs (metabolic equivalents).

Additionally, the page provides comparable activities and cadences, with equivalent efforts such as 33 minutes of fast rope jumping and a cadence of 50 steps/min maintained for 2500 steps over 50 minutes.
