Identify the electrical energy output of a hydroelectric power plant named Itaipu Dam in 2023 using Wolfram Alpha. Current datetime is: 2025-01-02 12:32.,"type ""Itaipu Dam electrical energy output 2023"" into the search bar with the placeholder text 'Enter what you want to calculate or know about' to find the required information about the dam's energy output in 2023.","The search query returned results about Itaipu Dam's annual power generation interpreted as 16.2 million h²TW² (hour squared terawatts squared), which may not directly provide the typical energy output value in terawatt-hours (TWh). The interpretation seems unusual for standard output measurements and may not meet the intended query. Consider revising the query for clarification or checking another source for verification."
Identify the electrical energy output of a hydroelectric power plant named Itaipu Dam in 2023 using Wolfram Alpha. Current datetime is: 2025-01-02 12:32.,"type ""Itaipu Dam power generation 2023 TWh"" into the search bar with the placeholder text 'Enter what you want to calculate or know about' to clarify the query and obtain the typical energy output measurement in terawatt-hours (TWh).","The search query returned the annual power generation for Itaipu Dam in 2023 as 89.5 terawatt-hours (TWh). This gives a clear and standard measurement of the dam's energy output for that year, meeting the query objective."
