Standing in the sun from 11:00 am with SPF 5 in Australia. Approximate time to sunburn for each skin type.,"type ""time to sunburn with SPF 5 in Australia at 11:00 am for different skin types"" into the search bar with the placeholder 'Enter what you want to calculate or know about' to find information on sunburn times.","The search query was interpreted by Wolfram Alpha, but the results displayed are erroneously using the location 'San Jose, California, United States' and a different start time rather than the specified conditions in Australia at 11:00 am. This leads to inaccurate data related to sunburn times for different skin types with SPF 5 under those conditions."
Standing in the sun from 11:00 am with SPF 5 in Australia. Approximate time to sunburn for each skin type.,"click on the text next to 'location' which shows 'San Jose, California, United States', and then type 'Australia' to set the correct location for accurate sunburn data.","The location 'San Jose, California, United States' is still set, despite the attempt to change it to 'Australia.' The start time and date are also incorrect. This is causing the data to remain inaccurate for the desired conditions of standing in the sun in Australia at 11:00 am with SPF 5."
Standing in the sun from 11:00 am with SPF 5 in Australia. Approximate time to sunburn for each skin type.,"click on the 'location' field where it currently reads 'San Jose, California, United States', manually delete this text, and type 'Australia' to update the measurement conditions to the correct location for accurate sunburn time data.","The location has been successfully updated to 'Australia' in the input section. However, the results still show the location as 'San Jose, California'. Additionally, the time is incorrectly set to '4:03 am PST'. The computation hasn't reflected the correct conditions for Australia at 11:00 am with SPF 5, as specified."
Standing in the sun from 11:00 am with SPF 5 in Australia. Approximate time to sunburn for each skin type.,"click the 'Compute' button next to the 'location', 'Australia', and 'start time', '2 Jan 2025', to recalculate the sunburn times based on the correct conditions set for location and time.","The location has been correctly set to 'Australia,' and the time is now displayed as '6:04 am AEDT, Thursday, January 2, 2025'. However, the intended start time of 11:00 am has not been reflected. The table shows approximate times to sunburn for various skin types with different SPF levels, but since the start time is incorrect, these times may not be entirely accurate for the desired scenario."
Standing in the sun from 11:00 am with SPF 5 in Australia. Approximate time to sunburn for each skin type.,"type ""11:00 am"" into the 'start time' field where the current time is incorrectly set to '6:04 am AEDT' to update the time to the correct condition, ensuring the sunburn time calculation is accurate.","The 'start time' field has been updated to '11:00 am' in the computational inputs, but the displayed input information still shows '6:04 am AEDT'. This indicates the time change hasn't been applied to the calculation. The data is still based on the incorrect time."
Standing in the sun from 11:00 am with SPF 5 in Australia. Approximate time to sunburn for each skin type.,click the 'Compute' button beside the updated 'start time' field where it is now showing '11:00 am' to recalculate the sunburn times based on the corrected time setting for accurate results.,"The location is now correctly set to 'Australia,' and the start time is accurately reflected as '11:00 am AEDT, Thursday, January 2, 2025.' The displayed table shows approximate times to sunburn for different skin types with SPF 5 applied. The results should now be valid for the specified conditions."
Standing in the sun from 11:00 am with SPF 5 in Australia. Approximate time to sunburn for each skin type.,Summarizing last observations,"The current observations show that the computational inputs have been updated to reflect the correct location and start time for sunburn calculation in Australia at 11:00 am with SPF 5. However, the summary table displayed on Wolfram Alpha still provides sunburn times for different skin types at various SPF levels. The table indicates that with SPF 5, sunburn times might fall between those labeled as SPF 15 and no sunscreen. To ensure accurate results aligned with the specified conditions, it is recommended to check that all input fields reflect the correct parameters.
