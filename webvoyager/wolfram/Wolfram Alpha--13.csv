Wolfram Alpha is an online computation platform that can perform various calculations, including inflation adjustments. To accurately achieve the task of finding out what 10,000 US dollars is worth in 1980 and 1970, we need to specify the query to focus on inflation adjustment. By changing the input to 'inflation adjusted value of 10000 USD in 1980 and 1970', we direct Wolfram Alpha to perform an inflation-related computation for the provided amounts in those specific years.",Went to https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=inflation+adjusted+value+of+10000+USD+in+1980+and+1970
