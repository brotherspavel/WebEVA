The result shown is the conversion of 12 pounds of 4-cyanoindole to moles, which is 38.288 moles. However, the screen does not show any information about the percentage of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N). It seems the search engine recognized part of the query but did not display the elemental percentages."
"Give 12 lbs of 4-cyanoindole, converted to molar and indicate the percentage of C, H, N.","type ""4-cyanoindole molecular formula percentage of C, H, N"" into the search bar with placeholder 'Enter what you want to calculate or know about'. This should prompt Wolfram Alpha to focus on providing the elemental composition percentages specifically.","The user successfully obtained the information about the elemental composition percentages of 4-cyanoindole. The mass percentages are as follows: Carbon (C) is 76.04%, Hydrogen (H) is 4.254%, and Nitrogen (N) is 19.71%."
"Give 12 lbs of 4-cyanoindole, converted to molar and indicate the percentage of C, H, N.",Summarizing last observations,"This summary reflects only the latest observations:

The user's task was to convert 12 lbs of 4-cyanoindole into moles and determine the percentage composition of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N). The user accessed Wolfram Alpha and entered queries to achieve this goal. The first query resulted in finding that 12 pounds of 4-cyanoindole equates to 38.288 moles.

Subsequently, the user adjusted the search query and successfully obtained the mass percentages of the elements in 4-cyanoindole: Carbon (C) at 76.04%, Hydrogen (H) at 4.254%, and Nitrogen (N) at 19.71%. The molecular formula, C9H6N2, was also confirmed.
