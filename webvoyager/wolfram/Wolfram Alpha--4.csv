Pack 24 circles in a circle radius r. Compare Densest known packing and Square packing. Then tell me the radius of the inner circles.,Going to https://www.wolframalpha.com/,Went to https://www.wolframalpha.com/
Pack 24 circles in a circle radius r. Compare Densest known packing and Square packing. Then tell me the radius of the inner circles.,type '24 circles packing in a circle' into the search bar with placeholder 'Enter what you want to calculate or know about' to find information about packing circles and compare the densest known and square packings.,"The search results provide information on different packing methods for 24 circles within a circle of radius \( r \).

1. **Densest Known Packing**:
   - Inner circle radius: \( 0.176939r \)
   - Filled fraction: 75.14%
   - Empty fraction: 24.86%

2. **Hexagonal Packing**:
   - Inner circle radius: \( 0.169724r \)
   - Filled fraction: 69.14%
   - 4.08% less dense than the densest known packing.

3. **Square Packing** is not visible here, but it would typically be expected to have an even lower filled fraction compared to the hexagonal and densest packings.

The densest known packing achieves the highest filled fraction."
Pack 24 circles in a circle radius r. Compare Densest known packing and Square packing. Then tell me the radius of the inner circles.,scroll to view more results about Square Packing and find the radius of inner circles for comparison with Densest and Hexagonal packings. This ensures all packing methods are analyzed appropriately.,"The screenshot provides information on three packing methods for 24 circles within a circle of radius \( r \). The comparisons are as follows:

1. **Densest Known Packing**:
   - Inner circle radius: \( 0.176939r \)
   - Filled fraction: 75.14%
   - Empty fraction: 24.86%

2. **Hexagonal Packing**:
   - Inner circle radius: \( 0.169724r \)
   - Filled fraction: 69.14%
   - Empty fraction: 30.86%
   - 4.08% less dense than the densest known packing.

3. **Square Packing**:
   - Inner circle radius: \( 0.163961r \)
   - Filled fraction: 64.52%
   - Empty fraction: 35.48%
   - 7.33% less dense than the densest known packing.

The densest known packing achieves the highest efficiency in terms of the filled fraction."
