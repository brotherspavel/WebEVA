Determine the convergence or divergence of the series Σ (n=1 to ∞) of 1/(n^3 + 1).,type 'convergence of sum 1/(n^3 + 1) from n=1 to infinity' into the input bar to determine the convergence or divergence of the series using WolframAlpha's computation capabilities.,"The WolframAlpha page indicates that the series \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^3 + 1} \) converges. An approximated sum is provided, showing the calculated value to converge around 0.686491."
Determine the convergence or divergence of the series Σ (n=1 to ∞) of 1/(n^3 + 1).,Summarizing last observations,"The most recent observations on WolframAlpha confirm that the series \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^3 + 1} \) converges. An approximate sum provided by the computation shows it converges to approximately 0.686491. The page also displays a partial sum formula and a graph illustrating the partial sums, further supporting the convergence claim. This summary reflects only the latest observations captured, and for a full understanding, the entire task history should be reviewed."
