Compute the length of a curve defined by y = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 5 from x = 0 to x = 3.,type 'arc length of y = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 5 from x=0 to x=3' into the search bar with placeholder 'Enter what you want to calculate or know about'. This will compute the length of the curve as specified in the task goal.,"The input was correctly interpreted, and the arc length of the curve y = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 5 from x = 0 to x = 3 is computed as approximately 39.24992727."
Compute the length of a curve defined by y = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 5 from x = 0 to x = 3.,Summarizing last observations,"The user successfully computed the arc length of the curve defined by \( y = 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 5 \) from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 3 \) on WolframAlpha. The result is approximately 39.24992727. The input was interpreted correctly, and the result is displayed with a plot of the curve, showing the integration setup for the arc length calculation. This summary reflects only the latest observations. For a complete understanding, refer to the full task history."
