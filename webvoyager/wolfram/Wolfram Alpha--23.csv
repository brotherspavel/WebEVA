Calculate the population growth rate of Canada from 2020 to 2023 using Wolfram Alpha. Current date is: 2025-01-04.,"type ""Canada population growth rate 2020 to 2023"" into the search bar. This is optimal because the query directly asks for the growth rate calculation over the specified years, and the search bar is where we input our questions on Wolfram Alpha. The search bar has the placeholder 'Enter what you want to calculate or know about'.","The query was successful. Wolfram Alpha provided the mean population growth rate for Canada from 2020 to 2023 as 0.9998% per year. The lowest rate during this period was 0.6911% in 2021, and the highest was 1.33% in 2023. A graph showing the population growth trend from 1970 to 2023 is also displayed."
