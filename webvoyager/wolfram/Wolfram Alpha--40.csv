"Approximate amount of fat burned by a 28yo, 172cm tall, 70kg woman running for 30min at a pace of 6min/mile.","type ""calories burned by a 28-year-old woman who is 172 cm tall and weighs 70 kg running at 6 min/mile for 30 minutes"" in the search bar with the placeholder 'Enter what you want to calculate or know about'. This action is optimal because Wolfram Alpha can interpret this query to provide detailed information about the energy expenditure for the specified activity and conditions.","The query was successful, and the result shows that a 28-year-old woman who is 172 cm tall and weighs 70 kg running for 30 minutes at a pace of 6 minutes per mile burns approximately 600 calories, with about 0.17 pounds of fat burned."
"Approximate amount of fat burned by a 28yo, 172cm tall, 70kg woman running for 30min at a pace of 6min/mile.",Summarizing last observations,"The most recent observation shows that a query was conducted on Wolfram Alpha to determine the energy expenditure of a 28-year-old female runner, 172 cm tall and weighing 70 kg, running at a pace of 6 minutes per mile for 30 minutes. The results indicate that approximately 600 calories are burned in this activity, equating to about 0.17 pounds of fat burned. Additional details from the current screenshots include metabolic properties such as an energy expenditure of 600 dietary calories, an estimated oxygen consumption of 31.7 gallons, and a metabolic equivalent of 16. The estimated heart rate for this activity was between 142.4 to 192 bpm, with a heart rate reserve of 124 bpm. Speed was recorded at 10 mph, with a total distance of 5 miles over 11,328 steps.
