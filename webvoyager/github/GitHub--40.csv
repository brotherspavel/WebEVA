Select Sign up on the GitHub homepage to see if email 'test123@gmail.com' already exists.,"Changing URL parameters. The task is to check an email address as part of the GitHub sign-up process, which requires interacting with GitHub's front-end form system to verify if the email is already registered. Since GitHub manages email validation through client-side scripting during the sign-up process, there is no direct URL manipulation that can simulate or complete this step. Therefore, navigation to the sign-up page (https://github.com/signup) is necessary to manually enter the email 'test123@gmail.com' into the designated field and check its availability.",Went to https://github.com/signup
Select Sign up on the GitHub homepage to see if email 'test123@gmail.com' already exists.,"Changing URL parameters. The task is to verify if a specific email ('test123@gmail.com') is already registered with GitHub by trying to sign up with it. The given URL (https://github.com/signup) is already the appropriate page for initiating the sign-up process on GitHub, and since verifying an email would typically involve manual input in the email field, it can't be completed by simply constructing a new URL. However, by appending '?source=header-home' to the current URL, we ensure we are at the correct starting point for a new sign-up attempt. The reasoning is that GitHub's signup page allows users to enter their email and immediately informs them if the email is already registered, which accomplishes the task of checking the email's availability.",Went to https://github.com/signup?source=header-home

Select Sign up on the GitHub homepage to see if email 'test123@gmail.com' already exists.,"Changing URL parameters. To check if the email 'test123@gmail.com' is already registered, we need to navigate to the sign-up page and input the email to trigger the availability check. However, since the action includes inputting data and receiving real-time feedback, constructing a URL that simulates this process via parameters is not feasible directly. Instead, the suggestion is to manually enter the email into the provided signup URL, which is already pre-set to handle email availability checks once you input the email on the page. Therefore, the closest conceptual adaptation involves pre-filling the email in contexts that allow URL parameters to declare pre-existing values, which GitHub's current exposed interface does not directly optimize for server-side checks without engagement from the user side in the UI. Thus, direct ""check"" URL formatting here implies user-side activity through a typical interactive approach, using the existing signup flow as a starting point.",Went to https://github.com/signup?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Femail%2Fcheck%3Femail%3Dtest123%40gmail.com
