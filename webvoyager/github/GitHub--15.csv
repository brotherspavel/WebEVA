Locate a repository on GitHub related to 'quantum computing' that has been updated within the last week and has at least 50 stars. Provide a brief description of the project.,Going to https://github.com/,Went to https://github.com/
Locate a repository on GitHub related to 'quantum computing' that has been updated within the last week and has at least 50 stars. Provide a brief description of the project.,click the menu icon with three horizontal lines in the top left corner to open the main navigation menu and access the search functionality for finding repositories.,"The main navigation menu has been opened, but it doesnâ€™t provide direct access to search for repositories. The search bar at the bottom says 'Search or jump to...', which you can use to search for repositories directly. The options in the menu do not specifically help in locating repositories by the criteria mentioned (updated within the last week and having at least 50 stars)."
Locate a repository on GitHub related to 'quantum computing' that has been updated within the last week and has at least 50 stars. Provide a brief description of the project.,"Changing URL parameters. The suggested URL is a GitHub search query for repositories related to 'quantum computing' with at least 50 stars, sorted by the most recently updated. This allows you to efficiently locate repositories that are related to quantum computing, meet the star threshold, and have been updated recently. The search query uses the parameter 'stars:>=50' to filter results by star count and 's=updated&o=desc' to sort by the most recently updated repositories.",Went to https://github.com/search?q=quantum+computing+stars:%3E=50&p=1&type=repositories&o=desc&s=updated
Locate a repository on GitHub related to 'quantum computing' that has been updated within the last week and has at least 50 stars. Provide a brief description of the project.,"click on the repository link 'qutech/qupulse' to open the repository page and get a brief description. This repository, being updated 49 minutes ago and having 56 stars, matches the criteria for 'quantum computing', recent update, and star count.","The user successfully located the repository 'qutech/qupulse' on GitHub, which matches the search criteria for a quantum computing-related project. The repository was updated 50 minutes ago and has 56 stars, which fulfills the requirement of being updated within the last week and having at least 50 stars. The project's description indicates that it is a quantum computing toolkit designed for qubit control, focusing on pulse-driven state manipulation of physical qubits in a hardware-independent manner. It allows for parameterization and sequencing of quantum pulses, supporting experimental quantum computing research and development."
Locate a repository on GitHub related to 'quantum computing' that has been updated within the last week and has at least 50 stars. Provide a brief description of the project.,Summarizing last observations,"The user located a GitHub repository named 'qutech/qupulse' related to quantum computing. This repository was updated 50 minutes ago and has 56 stars, meeting the criteria of being updated within the past week and having at least 50 stars. The project is a quantum computing toolkit designed for qubit control, offering a framework for parameterizing and sequencing quantum pulses, which can support experimental quantum computing research and development. The repository provides high-level, hardware-independent tools for manipulating quantum states, facilitating research at the RWTH Aachen University's Quantum Technology Group.
