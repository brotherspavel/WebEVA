Search for papers on 'neural networks for image processing' in the Computer Science category on ArXiv and report how many were submitted in the last week. Current date is: 2025-01-04.,"click on 'Computer Science (cs new, recent, search)' to narrow down the results to computer science papers and begin searching for relevant articles on neural networks for image processing.","The user has successfully navigated to the search interface for the Computer Science category on arXiv. The current screen allows them to enter search terms related to their query on 'neural networks for image processing'. There is also guidance on how to use the search fields effectively, including wildcard and phrase searches. However, the user has not yet entered any search terms specific to their task. Additionally, filtering by recent submissions (e.g., the last week) will require entering specific date filters in the search."
Search for papers on 'neural networks for image processing' in the Computer Science category on ArXiv and report how many were submitted in the last week. Current date is: 2025-01-04.,type 'neural networks for image processing' into the 'Search term' field and set date filter to find submissions from 2024-12-28 to 2025-01-04 to locate relevant papers submitted in the last week.,"The search results display papers submitted between 2024-12-28 and 2025-01-04. The top six papers listed have submission dates within this range. To determine the total number of submissions, you would need to either count these or check the search results further for additional pages."
