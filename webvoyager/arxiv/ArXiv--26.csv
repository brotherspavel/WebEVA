Current date is: 2025-01-04.,"click on 'Earth and Planetary Astrophysics' (astro-ph.EP) under the Physics section to view the recent papers in this category, which is necessary to identify those related to 'climate change modeling' published in the last week.","The user successfully navigated to the Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) category on ArXiv. The current page shows entries for recent submissions, totaling 30, but specifically displays 9 entries from Friday, January 3, 2025. However, none of the paper titles or brief descriptions mention 'climate change modeling', indicating none are directly related to the user's search terms. The user will need to search through the remaining submissions from December 31, 2024, to identify relevant papers if any."
Search for papers related to 'climate change modeling' on ArXiv and find out how many have been published in the Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP) category in the last week. Current date is: 2025-01-04.,"click on 'Tue, 31 Dec 2024' link under 'Authors and titles for recent submissions'. This action is optimal to continue reviewing other batch of submissions from the last week within the Earth and Planetary Astrophysics category to locate any papers related to 'climate change modeling', since the current list for Jan 3 does not contain any relevant titles.","The user viewed submissions from December 31, 2024, and did not find any related to 'climate change modeling'. They proceeded to view the submissions from December 30, 2024. Among these, paper [16] titled 'Habitability in 4-D: Predicting the Climates of Earth Analogs across Rotation and Orbital Configurations' is related to climate modeling. Therefore, one paper was found related to the user's search terms in the Earth and Planetary Astrophysics category in the past week as of January 4, 2025."
