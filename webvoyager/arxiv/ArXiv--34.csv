Provide the title and the abstract.,"type ""non-commutative geometry john"" into the search bar labeled with the placeholder ""Search..."" to find papers related to non-commutative geometry by authors named John, which aligns with the task of identifying the most recent such papers and working towards obtaining the title and abstract.","The search results on arXiv display several papers related to non-commutative geometry. Among the results, the most recent paper by an author named John is titled ""Finite spectral triples for the fuzzy torus"", authored by John W. Barrett and James Gaunt. It was submitted on 30 October, 2024, and the submission date aligns with being the most recent. The abstract discusses finite real spectral triples defined to characterize the non-commutative geometry of certain spaces. You may need to click ""More"" to view the full abstract if required."

Provide the title and the abstract.,"click ""More"" next to the abstract of the paper titled ""Finite spectral triples for the fuzzy torus"" to expand the full abstract, as this will allow for reading the entire abstract of the most recent paper found in the search, which is necessary to fully provide its content as requested by the task.","The full abstract for the paper titled ""Finite spectral triples for the fuzzy torus"" is now visible. The abstract describes how finite real spectral triples are defined to characterize the non-commutative geometry of a fuzzy torus, involving non-commutative analogues of flat tori with moduli determined by integer parameters. It mentions that each geometry has four different Dirac operators, which relate to the unique spin structures on a torus. The spectrum of the Dirac operator is calculated using quantum integer analogues from the spectrum of the corresponding commutative torus. This fulfills the task requirement to provide the title and full abstract of the most recent paper by an author named John on this topic."
