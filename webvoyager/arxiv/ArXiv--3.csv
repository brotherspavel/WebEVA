Since the task is to locate the most recent research paper about 'Algebraic Topology', we should use ArXiv's search function to specifically query for papers in this subject area. The current URL suggests a page listing recent papers in 'math.AT' (Algebraic Topology category), but to ensure accuracy and that we are getting the most recent paper, constructing a search query with the terms 'Algebraic Topology', sorting the results by the announcement date in descending order, is the most direct approach. The search parameters will display the most recent entry and provide access to the paper's title, authors, and abstract.",Went to https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Algebraic+Topology&searchtype=all&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=1&start=0

The paper is categorized under hep-th (High Energy Physics - Theory) and was submitted on January 2, 2025, with the original version submitted in December 2024. 

Abstract: The abstract discusses topological defect lines in holomorphic vertex operators algebras and superalgebras, including Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman Monster VOA with central charge \(c = 24\). It examines duality defects in the aforementioned algebras and establishes a general formula for certain related correlations, contributing to vertex algebra theory."
