According to the screenshot, the abstract highlights the importance of identifiable and interpretable deep generative models (DGMs), particularly deep discrete encoders (DDEs), for data with discrete latent layers. These models aim to preserve parameter identifiability and interpretability in high-stakes applications, contrasting with conventional deep learning models that often function as non-identifiable black boxes. DDEs employ accessible parameterization that assists in the statistical evaluation of the latent representations.
