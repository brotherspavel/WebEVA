"Searching Chinese Benchmark on ArXiv, how many papers announced in December 2023 mention being accepted for AAAI 2024? Current date is: 2025-01-04.","type ""Chinese Benchmark December 2023 AAAI 2024 accepted"" into the search bar to find relevant papers. This is optimal as it will directly search and filter results to find papers specifically mentioning acceptance to AAAI 2024 for the given criteria.","The current search query did not yield any results. The phrase 'Chinese Benchmark December 2023 AAAI 2024 accepted' was not found in any papers on ArXiv. This could be because the search query is too specific, or the terms don't align with the metadata fields typically indexed by ArXiv when papers are submitted. It's possible that papers do not explicitly mention ""Chinese Benchmark"" and specific conference acceptance in the searched fields.\n\nConsider simplifying or changing the search terms, using keywords separately or in various combinations, such as 'Chinese Benchmark', 'AAAI 2024', and 'December 2023', to yield a broader set of results that can be manually filtered."

Using simplified keywords might yield broader results that can be filtered for papers mentioning December 2023 announcements and AAAI 2024 acceptance.","The search for 'Chinese Benchmark AAAI 2024' returned two results. The first paper titled ""CORECODE: A Common Sense Annotated Dialogue Dataset with Benchmark Tasks for Chinese Large Language Models"" indicates it was announced in December 2023 and includes a comment about acceptance to AAAI 2024. The second paper, titled ""Benchmarking Large Language Models in Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"" while accepted to AAAI 2024, was originally announced in September 2023, so it doesn't meet the December 2023 criterion."
"Searching Chinese Benchmark on ArXiv, how many papers announced in December 2023 mention being accepted for AAAI 2024?
