Identify the most downloaded models on Hugging face that use the PaddlePaddle library.,"type ""PaddlePaddle"" into the search bar to find models using the PaddlePaddle library, as identifying these models is essential to achieve the task goal of finding the most downloaded models that use PaddlePaddle.","The user searched for ""PaddlePaddle"" but landed on the page for ""Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"" which does not seem to be related to PaddlePaddle as there is no indication or tags related to PaddlePaddle. The model is primarily associated with Meta and Llama, and uses PyTorch as per the tags provided. Therefore, the user did not progress towards identifying PaddlePaddle models. The page displays details about a specific Llama model including downloads, but this information is not related to the current task of finding PaddlePaddle models."
Identify the most downloaded models on Hugging face that use the PaddlePaddle library.,"click on the search bar at the top of the page and try searching for 'PaddlePaddle models', as this would refine the search results to possibly include models specifically using the PaddlePaddle library, which is needed to identify the most downloaded ones.","The user is still on the Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct page, which is not related to PaddlePaddle. The search for 'PaddlePaddle models' did not redirect them to a relevant page or search results for models that use the PaddlePaddle library. The page still contains information about the Llama model which uses PyTorch, not PaddlePaddle."
Identify the most downloaded models on Hugging face that use the PaddlePaddle library.,"Changing URL parameters. To find the most downloaded models on Hugging Face that specifically use the PaddlePaddle library, we can leverage Hugging Face's model search feature by specifying the library in the query parameters. The suggested URL includes `other=paddlepaddle`, which filters models to those using the PaddlePaddle library, and `sort=downloads`, which sorts these models by their download counts. This URL directly takes you to the desired section of the site, efficiently completing the task without needing to navigate through multiple pages.",Went to https://huggingface.co/models?other=paddlepaddle&sort=downloads
Identify the most downloaded models on Hugging face that use the PaddlePaddle library.,Summarizing last observations,"The most recent observations indicate that the user has successfully navigated to the model search page on Hugging Face with the filters set to display models using the PaddlePaddle library. The models are sorted by download counts, which directly aligns with the task goal of identifying the most downloaded PaddlePaddle models. The current screenshots show various models that meet these criteria, with names like 'PaddlePaddle/uie-x-base' and 'sijunhe/test_unet1d' among the list. Any additional details or context on earlier attempts to reach this task goal can be found by reviewing the complete task history."
