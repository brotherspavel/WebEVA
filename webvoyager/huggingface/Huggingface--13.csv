There is no visible information in the current screenshot regarding the 'spaces_between_special_tokens' parameter type or its default value in the LlamaTokenizer class documentation."
"Search for LLaMA in the huggingface doc, what type is the spaces_between_special_tokens parameter in LlamaTokenizer and what is its default value.","Changing URL parameters. To find information about the `spaces_between_special_tokens` parameter in the `LlamaTokenizer`, we should navigate to the Hugging Face Transformers documentation specific to LLaMA models. The link provided points directly to the section in the documentation where LLaMA-specific tokenizer information, including parameter details and their default values, would likely be listed. This section is part of the Transformers library documentation, where model-specific tokenizer configurations are documented.",Went to https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/llama#transformers.LlamaTokenizer
"Search for LLaMA in the huggingface doc, what type is the spaces_between_special_tokens parameter in LlamaTokenizer and what is its default value.",Summarizing last observations,"This summary reflects the most recent observations:

The user navigated to the Hugging Face Transformers documentation specifically for the `LlamaTokenizer`. The current screenshots display the `LlamaTokenizer` class, showing that the `spaces_between_special_tokens` parameter is of type `bool` and its default value is `False`.
