The screenshot does not show any Text-to-3D models or information directly related to Text-to-3D. Instead, it showcases a text generation model. Furthermore, while the model in question has a significant number of downloads (414,508 downloads in the last month), it is not indicated whether this model is Text-to-3D or if it's even the highest within that category. However, the screenshot does show that several 'Spaces' are using this specific model, but this does not fulfill the task requirement focused on Text-to-3D models."

The search bar is available at the top, allowing you to enter your query for Text-to-3D models again. The page currently highlights trending models but does not display any models related to Text-to-3D or their download statistics directly. You can proceed by typing 'Text-to-3D' in the search bar to find the information you are looking for."

Instead, the page displays the 'Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct', which is a text generation model, not related to Text-to-3D models. This result is similar to the previous one, indicating either a misstep in executing the search correctly or an issue with available data on Text-to-3D models on Hugging Face. The model exhibits a high download count of 414,508 in the last month, and there are multiple Spaces using it (100 listed), but these do not pertain to Text-to-3D technology, thus not fulfilling the task goal."
What is the current Text-to-3D model with the highest number of downloads and tell me are there Spaces that use the model.,"click the 'Models' tab at the top of the page to directly navigate to the section listing all available models, where you can perform a more refined search for Text-to-3D models, which may not be captured correctly using the general search bar.","The current screenshot from the 'Models' tab does not include any explicitly labeled Text-to-3D models. It lists various models, including text generation, Text-to-Image, Text-to-Speech, and Sentence Similarity models, but none are classified as Text-to-3D. The screenshot primarily highlights models based on trending popularity or recent updates. It seems the specific category or tag for Text-to-3D models may not be present, or possibly not clearly labeled, making it difficult to fulfill the current task. Additionally, there are no indications of Spaces using any specific Text-to-3D models since none are visible."
What is the current Text-to-3D model with the highest number of downloads and tell me are there Spaces that use the model.,"click the 'Add filters' button to refine the search criteria specifically for Text-to-3D models, which might help highlight relevant models that are not immediately visible on the current listing.","The 'Add Filters' option is open, displaying a variety of tasks to select from, including 'Text-to-3D' under the Computer Vision category. This indicates that you can refine the search for models specifically categorized as 'Text-to-3D', which should potentially help find relevant models. However, the filtering has not yet been applied, so no models are visible yet. It's necessary to select the 'Text-to-3D' filter and then apply it to view the relevant models and their download statistics, along with any Spaces that use them."
What is the current Text-to-3D model with the highest number of downloads and tell me are there Spaces that use the model.,"click 'Text-to-3D' under the Computer Vision category to filter the models by the Text-to-3D task, which will make it easier to identify models in this specific category.","The filtered results for the Text-to-3D category are displayed. The model 'openai/shap-e' has the highest number of downloads with 19.6k. This indicates it's the most downloaded Text-to-3D model listed. The availability of Spaces that use the model is not visible in the current screenshot, so further exploration may be needed to determine that aspect."
What is the current Text-to-3D model with the highest number of downloads and tell me are there Spaces that use the model.,"click 'openai/shap-e' from the list of filtered models, as it has the highest number of downloads (19.6k) among the displayed Text-to-3D models. This will allow you to view additional details about the model and check if there are any Spaces using it.","The model 'openai/shap-e' is confirmed as the Text-to-3D model with the highest downloads, having 19,599 downloads in the last month. Additionally, it is used by 57 Spaces, some of which are listed in the screenshot. This fulfills the task by identifying the model with the highest downloads and confirming active Spaces utilizing it."
What is the current Text-to-3D model with the highest number of downloads and tell me are there Spaces that use the model.,Summarizing last observations,"The most recent observation shows that the Text-to-3D model ""Shap-E"" by OpenAI has 19,599 downloads in the last month.
