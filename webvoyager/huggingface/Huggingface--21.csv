"Look up the tour about how to use the 'pipeline' feature in the Hugging Face Transformers library for sentiment analysis, and identify the default model it uses.",Summarizing last observations,"The most recent observations show that the user accessed the 'TUTORIALS' section within the Transformers documentation to find guidance on using the 'pipeline' feature for sentiment analysis. The current screenshots provide further insights, showing detailed usage examples of the pipeline feature. It highlights that the 'pipeline' abstraction facilitates easy model inference and lists sentiment analysis as a task. The output confirms that by using `pipeline(""text-classification"")`, you apply a pre-configured pipeline for sentiment analysis. Although the screenshots do not explicitly list the default model name, the given examples suggest this is a pre-set configuration in the Transformers library. For comprehensive understanding and any model specifics, referring to the full task history and further exploration of additional documentation is recommended."
