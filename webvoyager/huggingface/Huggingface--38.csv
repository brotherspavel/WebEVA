"Investigate the 'transformers' library in the Hugging Face documentation, focusing on how to add new tokens to a tokenizer.","click ""Tokenizers doc"" under the Documentation section. This action is optimal as it likely leads directly to information about tokenizers, which includes how to add new tokens to a tokenizer, aligning with the task goal of investigating this specific modification process in the transformers library.","The 'Tokenizers doc' link has been clicked or highlighted in the Documentation section. This should lead to documentation specifically about tokenizers, which likely includes information on adding new tokens to a tokenizer within the Hugging Face library."
"Investigate the 'transformers' library in the Hugging Face documentation, focusing on how to add new tokens to a tokenizer.","click ""Transformers doc"" under Documentation. This action is optimal as it will likely take you directly to the specific section of the documentation where you can find detailed information on how to work with transformers, including modifying tokenizers to add new tokens.","The 'Transformers doc' link under the Documentation section is visible. Clicking this link should direct you to detailed information on the transformers library, where you can find instructions on adding new tokens to a tokenizer."
"Investigate the 'transformers' library in the Hugging Face documentation, focusing on how to add new tokens to a tokenizer.","click ""Transformers doc"" under the Documentation section. This will likely lead you to detailed information about the transformers library, where you can find instructions on adding new tokens to a tokenizer.","The current webpage shows the main documentation links under the Documentation section. The 'Transformers doc' link is visible, which will lead to detailed documentation about the transformers library. Clicking it should provide access to information on adding new tokens to a tokenizer."
"Investigate the 'transformers' library in the Hugging Face documentation, focusing on how to add new tokens to a tokenizer.","click ""Transformers doc"" under the Documentation section. This action is appropriate as it should lead directly to the detailed page of the 'transformers' library documentation, where you can find the necessary information about modifying tokenizers, including adding new tokens.","The current screenshot shows the documentation resources available on Hugging Face's website. The user is attempting to click on the ""Transformers doc"" link. This link is clearly visible and categorized under the Documentation section. Clicking this link will most likely direct the user to the Transformers documentation page, where detailed information about adding new tokens to a tokenizer in the Transformers library can be found."
"Investigate the 'transformers' library in the Hugging Face documentation, focusing on how to add new tokens to a tokenizer.","Changing URL parameters. The given task is to investigate how to add new tokens to a tokenizer using the 'transformers' library. The current URL points to the main index of the Hugging Face Transformers documentation. Navigating through the documentation, the relevant section for adding new tokens can be found under the 'Transformers' documentation in the 'tokenization_utils' page, specifically at the 'PreTrainedTokenizer.add_tokens' method, which addresses exactly how to add new tokens. This URL directly leads to the documentation of this method, thus fulfilling the task goal efficiently.",Went to https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/tokenization_utils#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.add_tokens
"Investigate the 'transformers' library in the Hugging Face documentation, focusing on how to add new tokens to a tokenizer.","click ""Expand 15 parameters"" under the PreTrainedTokenizerBase class section. This action is optimal because it will reveal additional details about the methods and attributes of the tokenizer class, which may include information pertinent to adding new tokens.","The user has successfully expanded the ""Parameters"" section for the PreTrainedTokenizerBase class, displaying a list of configurable attributes. Some of these attributes may be pertinent to the task of adding new tokens to a tokenizer. Notably, the parameters include `bos_token`, `eos_token`, and `model_input_names`, which are related to token management. However, there is no direct mention of how to add new tokens, implying the user may need to search further or expand additional sections to find the specific instructions on adding new tokens to a tokenizer."
"Investigate the 'transformers' library in the Hugging Face documentation, focusing on how to add new tokens to a tokenizer.","scroll down the page to see more content. This action is optimal because the section visible suggests more information on tokenizer utilities might be located further down, potentially including how to add new tokens to a tokenizer.","The current section of the 'Transformers' documentation is titled 'Utilities for Tokenizers.' There is a list of parameters relevant to tokenizers, such as 'model_max_length', 'padding_side', and 'truncation_side'. Importantly, the `additional_special_tokens` parameter is mentioned. This parameter is used to add additional special tokens to a tokenizer. It states that these tokens can be added to ensure they are skipped during decoding if `skip_special_tokens` is set to True, and if they are not part of the vocabulary, they will be added at the end of the vocabulary. This information directly relates to the task of adding new tokens to a tokenizer."
"Investigate the 'transformers' library in the Hugging Face documentation, focusing on how to add new tokens to a tokenizer.",Summarizing last observations,"The most recent observations reveal that the user has navigated to the detailed documentation for tokenizers within the Hugging Face Transformers library. The current screenshots show sections of the documentation that cover various tokenizer utilities, including parameters for custom token addition such as `additional_special_tokens` and functionalities like `batch_encode_plus` and `batch_decode`. These utilities suggest methods for handling custom and special tokens, which align with adding new tokens to a tokenizerâ€”a focal point of the user's task goal.
