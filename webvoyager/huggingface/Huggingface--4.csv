"Locate an open-source conversational AI model on Hugging Face, trained in English and list its main features and applications.","type ""conversational AI model English open-source"" into the search bar labeled ""Search models, datasets, users..."" to find an open-source conversational AI model trained in English.","The user successfully located a conversational AI model page on Hugging Face. The model is ""meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct,"" which is developed by Meta. This model is built for multilingual large language generation, optimized for dialogue use cases, and includes features like instruction tuning, fine-tuning with supervised and reinforcement learning. This makes it suitable for applications in multilingual dialogue and outperforming many open-source and closed chat models."
