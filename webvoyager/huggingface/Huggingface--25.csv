The page provides a general introduction to Transformers, including their capabilities and the frameworks they support, like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. However, there isn't specific information or a visible link related to loading adapters with PEFT or details about loading models in 8bit or 4bit on the current view of the page. The user may need to scroll further or utilize the search bar to find the specific tutorial regarding PEFT adapters."

This page provides an overview of the transformers and does not specifically mention loading adapters with PEFT or methods to load in 8bit or 4bit. To progress, you might try using the search bar with more focused terms like 'PEFT adapters 8bit 4bit', or explore links within the Transformer documentation that might lead to more detailed sections about PEFT."

For instance, the first entry mentions 'gsarti / llama-3.1-8b-rebus-solver-adapters' and indicates 'This model is a parameter-efficient fine-tuned version of LLaMA-3.1 8B trained for 5070 steps...', which suggests the documentation covers both PEFT adapters and 8bit precision. You might want to click on these entries to explore more specific details about how to load models using PEFT in 8bit or 4bit precision."
"In the Hugging Face documentation, find the tutorial on loading adapters with PEFT, tell me how to load in 8bit or 4bit.","click the 'gsarti / llama-3.1-8b-rebus-solver-adapters' link to view the README documentation, as it specifically mentions PEFT Adapters and loading models in 8bit precision, which aligns with the task to find out how to load adapters in 8bit or 4bit configurations.","The documentation details the use of PEFT adapters with LLaMA-3.1 8B in both 4-bit and 8-bit precision. It mentions that the model was trained in 4-bit precision using QLora and TRL. The setup also provides FP16 merged and 8-bit GGUF versions. For loading in 4-bit precision, an example code snippet is provided demonstrating how to import from `unsloth` and set `load_in_4bit = True`. This implies that loading models in 8bit could involve similar configuration adjustments, using references provided for GGUF versions."
"In the Hugging Face documentation, find the tutorial on loading adapters with PEFT, tell me how to load in 8bit or 4bit.",Summarizing last observations,"The most recent observations provide insight into a resource from Hugging Face documentation related to the use of PEFT Adapters. Specifically, the ""LLaMA-3.1 8B Verbalized Rebus Solver - PEFT Adapters IT"" page details a model trained in 4-bit precision and discusses the availability of 8-bit GGUF versions for local execution. The example on the page demonstrates how to load a model using a parameter called `load_in_4bit=True` in the script, indicating how this precision setting can be applied during model inference. This summary only covers the latest findings, and for a comprehensive understanding, the complete task history should be reviewed."
